#### Description



#### Milestones (if any)

##### Coding starts

* Benchmark code with larger and larger datasets; take note of bottlenecks; plan strategies for memory mapping

##### 1st evaluation

* Report on bottlenecks etc.

##### 2nd evaluation

* Memory mapping implemented

##### Final

* Memory mapping implemented and tested
