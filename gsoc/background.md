# Background: Start Here!

### What is GSoC? 

Google Summer of Code is a remote summer coding program funded by 
Google. Google distributes funds to open software development organizations to 
recruit new developers and mentors for summer mentorships. You get paid to write 
software at home (or wherever you like), with guidance from expert mentors 
distributed around the globe.

To apply to be a GSoC student, you must write and application to GSoC and one or
more applications to OpenAstronomy. Each summer, several projects are offered by 
OpenAstronomy mentors, with well-defined scope and pre-requisite 
experience. If you are selected by OpenAstronomy, you will be a GSoC student.

### What is OpenAstronomy?

OpenAstronomy is an umbrella organization which acts as an interface between
the Google Summer of Code and several open source, open development projects
in the astronomical community, including [astropy](http://www.astropy.org), 
[sunpy](http://sunpy.org), and 
[several other projects in the astronomical community](http://openastronomy.org/members/). 
It coordinates mentors and projects for Google Summer of Code mentorships 
related to astronomy.

### What is the application process?

You must submit your application to the Google Summer of Code in two parts -- 
one for Google, and one for your potential project mentor. There's some basic 
biographical information that Google needs for their part of the application, 
and we will ask you for more project-specific personal backaground information 
in the OpenAstronomy application. 

The complete details on applying are in the [GSoC Student Guide].

### Who is eligible to apply to GSoC?

OpenAstronomy is actively seeking applicants who are undergraduates or graduate 
students with experience developing software for astronomy in 
Python and other languages. We are looking for students who have or are pursuing
degrees in astronomy (or physics), who are interested in developing open source 
software. You don't need to be a Python guru or an astronomical coordinate 
system expert to be eligible -- projects are available that cover a range of 
previous experience in Python and/or astronomy. Underrepresented students from
anywhere around the world are especially encouraged to apply.

### Testimonials

> In the summer after my second year of graudate school, I didn't have funding
to work on any projects in my home department. I applied and was selected for
GSoC 2015, and I worked with another student and several encouraging mentors on
developing a new astropy affliated package, called 
[astroplan](http://astroplan.readthedocs.io/). The program greatly improved
my coding style, taught me loads about managing large projects, version control,
testing, and packaging. Do you have a summer without research funding? Apply!

> After spending the summer of 2015 as an intern at NIST, I got really
fascinated by how much Python aided scientists get the best out their data.
Then, while looking for Python projects to perform data fitting and modeling,
I found AstroPy. I got really surprised by how easy and intuitive data fitting
can be done with the astropy API. That motivated me to start learning git and
later contributing code and documentation for the project. Then in the summer
of 2016 I to applied to the GSoC to work on PSF photometry for
[photutils](https://www.github.com/astropy/photutils) and got selected! :)
One of the best parts of the GSoC was the amount of learning I got by being
mentored by experts in software development and astronomy! If you want to know
more about my journey during the GSoC 2016 see my
[blog posts](https://mirca.github.io/posts). Also check out some
[tips](https://mirca.github.io/gsoc-application/) before applying.
