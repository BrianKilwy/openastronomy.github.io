# Background: Start Here!

### What is GSoC? 

Google Summer of Code is a remote summer coding internship program funded by 
Google. Google distributes funds to open software development organizations to 
recruit new developers and mentors for summer internships. You get paid to write 
software at home (or wherever you like), with guidance from expert mentors 
distributed around the globe.

To apply to be a GSoC intern, you must write an application to GSoC and an 
application to OpenAstronomy. Each summer, several projects are offered by 
potential OpenAstronomy mentors, with well-defined scope and pre-requisite 
experience. If you are selected by both Google and OpenAstronomy, you will be
a GSoC intern.

### What is OpenAstronomy?

OpenAstronomy is an umbrella organization which acts as an interface between
the Google Summer of Code and several open source, open development projects
in the astronomical community, including astropy and sunpy. It coordinates
mentors and projects for Google Summer of Code internships related to astronomy.

### What is the application process?

You must submit your application to the Google Summer of Code in two parts -- 
one for Google, and one for your potential project mentor. There's some basic 
biographical information that Google needs for their part of the application, 
and we will ask you for more project-specific personal backaground information 
in the OpenAstronomy application. 

The complete details on applying are in the [GSoC Student Guide].

### Who is eligible to apply to GSoC?

OpenAstronomy is actively seeking applicants who are senior undergraduates or
junior graduate students with experience developing software for astronomy in 
Python and other languages. We are looking for students who have or are pursuing
degrees in astronomy (or physics), who are interested in developing open source 
software. You don't need to be a Python guru or an astronomical coordinate 
system expert to be eligible -- projects are available that cover a range of 
previous experience in Python and/or astronomy. Underrepresented students are 
especially encouraged to apply.

### Testimonials

> In the summer after my second year of graudate school, I didn't have funding
to work on any projects in my home department. I applied and was selected for
GSoC 2015, and I worked with another student and several encouraging mentors on
developing a new astropy affliated package, called 
[astroplan](http://astroplan.readthedocs.io/). The internship greatly improved
my coding style, taught me loads about managing large projects, version control,
testing, and packaging. Do you have a summer without research funding? Apply!
